# BUBBLING AND STUFF

Focusing on some background stuff I didn't even know exisisted but would have helped on the Test-it-out project I am working on.

# TIL
* bubbling - a div in a div in a div will bubble back up
* propagation - you can use e.stopPropagation to stop bubbling
* once: set it to true and you can use it to stop a button being repeatedly clicked
* capture (is ian options object) - it goes bubble down, run the function on the way down rather than up (on default false)
